# Poke-Generator

## Project Details

This repo contains the notebook that hosted the code for fine-tuning Stable Diffusion 2-1 on a dataset of Pokemon and Pokemon Card Images

This project used 2 different fine-tuning strategies, a standard fine-tuning strategy and a LoRA based approach.

The links will lead you to the respective hugging face repositories that will go more into detail of what was done and how to use the models.
